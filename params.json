Libraries will not be used, and there will be a\r\nverbose amount of documentation.\r\n\r\n<img align=\"right\" width=\"350\" style=\"border:1px solid #ccc;\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheIronDeveloper/dom-to-canvas/master/images/dom-to-canvas-2.jpg\">\r\n\r\n## Demo App\r\n\r\n* [Demo Here](http://dom-to-canvas.herokuapp.com/)\r\n* [Demo Repository](https://github.com/TheIronDeveloper/dom-to-canvas/tree/demo)\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nI welcome any and all contributions.
