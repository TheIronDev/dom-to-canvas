# Dom-to-canvas

The primary intent of this script is to render a DOM tree onto a canvas in a aesthetically pleasing manner.

The secondary intent is to serve as an educational primer. Libraries will not be used, and there will be a
verbose amount of documentation.


## Demo App

* [Demo Here](http://dom-to-canvas.herokuapp.com/)

## Contributing

I welcome any and all contributions. My only requests are to please avoid using libraries (I want to know
whats going on under the hood), and please include a healthy chunk of documentation.
